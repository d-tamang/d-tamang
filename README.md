## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub! 😄


I am a former tech sales-woman turned full stack software developer.


I recently completed App Academy, a rigorous 16 week coding bootcamp, where I completed 3 projects: a clone, an original single-page website, and a web game. I love the challenge and creative freedom that come with coding and am always striving to learn more. Currently, I'm learning Python and React Native.


Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/disneetamang/) or browse my [personal website](https://d-tamang.github.io/disnee-tamang/) to check out my projects!


Or, just click on the repo's below. You know the drill. 😉
